# Campus Book Exchange

## Project Overview
Campus Book Exchange is a marketplace application designed for college students to buy, sell, and exchange textbooks efficiently. This platform addresses the high costs and logistical challenges associated with acquiring academic books through traditional retail avenues.

## Problem and Domain
College students often face significant expenses acquiring textbooks each semester. Additionally, once a semester concludes, these books often collect dust without a clear path for resale or reuse. The domain of this application is a student-to-student exchange platform specifically for textbooks.

## Solution Description
The solution is an online platform that facilitates the listing, searching, buying, and selling of textbooks among students. The platform will include robust user management, secure transaction processing, and intuitive navigation interfaces.
